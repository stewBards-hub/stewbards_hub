Alright folks  - we need folks, right?
Hence, our humble beginnings start with ideas on how to enable an open source community to grow... 
I believe we don't need one, unified community, but rather a whole swarm of teams and individuals, of groups and communities that decide for themselves how to organize and communicate amongst one another...
however, offering some infrastructure for sharing inspirarion, recruiting cooperators, gathering feedback from a broad and diverse perspective and also for the fun of it, laughing, talking, bantering and chatting, painting and playing with interesting people from all over the world could turn out to be quite beautiful in it's own right.

Especially this last part of creating a space where light and serious, philosophical and technical, social and ecological concerns collide, critique and inventiveness meet to restructure and reprogram, our conception of seperation and our notions of control; 
this tension that lives at the border between what we think to know and want to master, and that which is out of reach, urging us to move closer and take a dive into deep waters; 
this project, if it is to grow, needs strong roots!

So hereby, I present to you: 
THE COMMUNITYCATION STACK: 

Reddit: 
:public-oriented; 
:archive-like functionality through
:organization of knowledge and projects: FLAIRS!


One of the most important flairs, and actually, the only one right now, would be the global flair:
the Librarian takes submissions and comments that either use that flair or the @global 
tag in discord to automatically post (and update) said submission on the other platform, to enable a bridge between the two primary platforms for communication as of now. 
So, anything you deem important enough for all of the community to see, flair with global/ tag with @global! 

So stuff from discord will be posted on reddit and vice versa; 
but why¿ why not just one?

So Discord is to be used for more 
:quick paced conversations; 
: hanging out and socializing
:team-meetings, 

-> basically, anything real time thrives on discord, whereas stuff that benefits from a more long-term, structured discussion might be more adapt to reddit. 
Basically, this way we can have our cake and eat it too, gain more traction by being more comfortable to engage with for people that favor one platform over the other, while still being able to form a coherent whole through using the @global tunnel!

With that being said, 
state of Development:
-basic functionality✔️
-flair(reddit) to channel(discord) translation 🔜
-actual deployment to server so that this actually works🔜  (perhaps  Render? fly.io? own server?)
